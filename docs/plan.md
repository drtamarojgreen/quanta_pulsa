# Development Plan for QuantaPulsa

This document outlines the development roadmap for QuantaPulsa, from initial scoping to advanced feature implementation.

### Phase 1: Foundation and Scoping

*   **Define App Scope and Target LLM Use Cases:**
    *   Identify primary LLM architectures to support (e.g., GPT, Claude, Llama).
    *   Detail the core metrics for monitoring: latency, semantic coherence, token usage, and sentiment analysis.
    *   Establish the boundaries of the advisory systemâ€”what it will and will not recommend.
    *   Define target use cases, such as customer support, content creation, and internal knowledge management.

### Phase 2: Core Feature Implementation

*   **Design Monitoring and Alerting Mechanisms:**
    *   Develop a data pipeline for ingesting LLM agent communication logs.
    *   Create a real-time dashboard for visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs).
    *   Implement a rules engine for defining custom alert thresholds (e.g., latency > 2s, coherence score < 0.8).
    *   Set up notification channels for alerts (e.g., email, Slack, webhooks).

### Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities

*   **Implement Advisory and Alignment Modules:**
    *   Build a suggestion engine that provides actionable recommendations for improving agent performance.
    *   Develop a 'consistency checker' to cross-reference an agent's statements against a knowledge base or previous responses.
    *   Introduce a feedback loop for human supervisors to rate the quality of agent responses and refine the monitoring algorithms.

### Phase 4: Expansion and Integration

*   **Integrate Multi-Agent Coordination Where Relevant:**
    *   Design a framework for monitoring communication and collaboration between multiple LLM agents.
    *   Develop visualization tools to map multi-agent workflows and identify bottlenecks or misalignments.
    *   Create protocols for ensuring that multi-agent systems adhere to collective goals and ethical guidelines.
