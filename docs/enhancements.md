# Future Enhancements for QuantaPulsa

This document outlines potential future enhancements for the QuantaPulsa platform. These features are designed to extend its capabilities and provide deeper insights into LLM agent behavior.

### Advanced Anomaly Detection via Machine Learning
*   **Description:** Move beyond rule-based alerts to a system that uses machine learning to identify subtle or novel anomalies. This would involve training models on historical agent data to learn baseline behaviors and flag statistically significant deviations.
*   **Value:** This would enable the detection of more complex issues, such as gradual topic drift or sophisticated forms of 'fibbing' that static rules might miss. It would also reduce the need for manual threshold configuration.

### Expanded Integration with External Knowledge Bases
*   **Description:** Allow QuantaPulsa to connect to external data sources, such as company databases, public APIs, or curated knowledge graphs. The system could then cross-reference an agent's statements against these trusted sources to verify factual accuracy.
*   **Value:** This would provide a powerful fact-checking mechanism, significantly increasing the reliability of LLM agents in information-critical applications. It would help ground agent responses in verified data.

### Real-time Multi-Agent Workflow Visualization
*   **Description:** For systems that use multiple LLM agents working in concert, this feature would provide a dynamic graph visualization of their interactions. It would map the flow of information between agents, highlighting dependencies, bottlenecks, and communication patterns.
*   **Value:** This would offer unprecedented transparency into the inner workings of multi-agent systems, making it easier to debug, optimize, and understand their collective behavior.

### User-Customizable Alerting and Reporting
*   **Description:** Greatly expand the customization options for how users are notified of issues. This could include building a drag-and-drop interface for creating custom reports, designing role-based notification rules, and allowing for programmatic control over alerting via an API.
*   **Value:** This would allow different teams and stakeholders to tailor QuantaPulsa to their specific needs, ensuring that the right people get the right information at the right time. It would make the platform more flexible and adaptable to a wider range of organizational workflows.
