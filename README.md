## About QuantaPulsa
QuantaPulsa is a sophisticated monitoring and advisory tool designed to ensure the reliability and ethical performance of Large Language Model (LLM) agents. It continuously measures response coherence, latency, and internal consistency to detect and flag potential 'fibbing' or hallucinations in real-time. By providing early warnings and actionable insights, QuantaPulsa enables proactive corrections, enhancing the trustworthiness and effectiveness of LLM applications.

## How It Works
QuantaPulsa integrates with your LLM agents to capture and analyze their activity. It uses a multi-faceted approach to monitoring:
- **Semantic Analysis:** The tool assesses the logical and contextual coherence of the agent's responses over time.
- **Behavioral Monitoring:** It tracks operational metrics like response latency and consistency to identify deviations from baseline performance.
- **Pattern Recognition:** QuantaPulsa learns the agent's typical behavior and uses this model to flag anomalous outputs that may indicate a hallucination or a loss of context.

When an issue is detected, the system generates a detailed alert, allowing developers or supervisors to intervene and make necessary adjustments.

## Key Features
- **Real-time LLM Activity Pulse Monitoring:** Continuously track the operational status and conversational flow of your LLM agents. Get a live feed of their performance metrics on a centralized dashboard.
- **Latency and Coherence Tracking:** Monitor the time an agent takes to respond and analyze the logical consistency of its outputs. Abrupt changes in latency or a drop in coherence can be early indicators of performance issues.
- **Early Detection of Inconsistent Outputs:** QuantaPulsa's advanced algorithms are trained to spot outputs that are factually incorrect, self-contradictory, or nonsensical. This "fibbing" detection helps maintain the integrity of your agent's responses.
- **Customizable Alert Thresholds:** Configure alert sensitivity to match your specific needs. Set custom thresholds for latency, coherence scores, and inconsistency triggers to minimize false positives and focus on the most critical issues.

## Use Cases
- **Customer Support Bots:** Ensure that AI-powered customer service agents provide accurate and consistent information.
- **Content Generation:** Monitor LLMs used for creative writing or marketing copy to prevent the generation of off-brand or nonsensical content.
- **Virtual Assistants:** Keep personal and professional AI assistants reliable and on-task.
- **Critical Information Systems:** In fields like finance or healthcare, where accuracy is paramount, QuantaPulsa provides an essential layer of oversight for LLM-driven systems.
